  "Access and manipulate annotations.

  Annotations are arbitrary properties associated with values that can be used for a variety
  of use cases. Typically you define a \"type\" using `defannot` specifying its attributes.
  Each of the types and attributes can have arbitrary properties - key/value pairs - associated
  with them.

  This namespace provides functions and macros to define and access annotations.")
